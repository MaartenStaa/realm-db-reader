# Realm Database Reader

This is a Rust library that provides basic functionality for reading data from a
Realm database. For usage and examples, please check the
[documentation](https://docs.rs/realm-db-reader/).

## Supported

This library supports reading `.realm` files of version `9.9`, which are not
encrypted. Support for other versions _may_ be added in the future.

In specific, you can:

- Open a Realm file
- List and open tables in the database
- Read rows in those tables
- Find rows by a known value for indexed columns
- Easily convert rows to a native Rust struct

## Shortcomings

Other than the limitations mentioned above regarding the Realm version, and not
handling encryption, this library does not support:

- Creating or writing Realm databases
- Tables with columns of the following types:
  - Enums
  - Binary
  - Mixed
  - Old datetime (the new datetime column type is supported)
  - Decimal
- Finding _multiple_ rows by a known value for indexed columns
